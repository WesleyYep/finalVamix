This isn't ideal but the other developer discussion was screwing up

***Stars next to stuff Matt has written



***In my latest/this commit I have added the video player to the editor tab with a simple button that when first clicked lets the user choose a file to play, it then works as a pause play button.
The layout is currently just a simple box layout as that was quick and easy but we will have to work on it at some point.
My next task will be to have a seperate button to choose the file. Also I will add a stop button that stops the video rather then pausing it (in preperation for another video to be played I guess)

Testing pushing to github---

List of tasks:
- stop video – matt
- choose file - matt
- overwrite if download exists - wesley
- strip audio - wesley
- replace audio track 
- overlay audio on existing track
- various volumes
- fast forward/ fast back
- create title and credits

---For layouts, I would suggest using MigLayout, which is what I used for assignment 2, and was also used last semester for the Flickr browser. It's really easy to use and to see how everything is laid out.

***I started using MigLayout for the downloads panel, Im a little confused as to how it works so I will have to do some research on it.  
I have also added a stop button which gets rid of the current video so a new one can be loaded, im not sure if stop is the correct name for it.  There will be a load button added at some point so that the user isn't expected to click stop then play in order to start a new video.
Yeah, you did a pretty good job with the MigLayout.
Sorry for not reading this earlier, I didn't realise that you had assigned yourself the choose file feature. I'll stick with audio features for now, to avoid clashes lol

***What you have done is great. Your more then welcome to continue adding features that I am only talking about :)
Unfortunately I hadn't commited my latest changes so it took a while to fix the conflicts. I have now worked out this miglayout thing a bit better and got the video player expanding as it should.
Next I am going to look into getting a “progress bar” of sorts that keeps track of where we are in the video and can be clicked to move to another spot in the video (not sure if this is even do-able or what its actually called)
Also I added a fast forwarding and rewinding button that don't do anything yet. It looks like there is no easy methods in vlcj to do this so it may take a bit of thought when I finally get around to it.

---Alright, this time I remembered to get your changes before adding mine.
I added strip, replace, and overlay buttons. Only strip and replace are working at the moment. I moved the video load filechooser to the top, so that it looked a bit tidier. Layout is still a draft though, I just chucked the audio features at the bottom. Ideally we should try to get it to look like your sketch later.
Also I havent added any error checking functionality yet. So it may crash if wrong input is entered.

***I added a Jslider which looks nice, and moves along with the music/video.
There are a few problems however.  Some videos don't contain the length information (namely the video I have been testing with which I just got from some random, probably dodgy, site) so the slider just flips out.  (we may be able to ignore this problem but ill look into it)
Also when the video finishes we need to change the pause button back to a play button (and deactiviate the stop button), which shouldn't be too hard to do.

***I made the forward and backward buttons do stuff.  It can probably be improved but yeah.
I might look into the use of icons next. 

***In terms of the audio stuff you have been doing, it seems to be good (especially as you seeminingly did it really quick) but there are a few issues, such as clicking cancel when choosing a file.
Also in terms of the gui its starting to get rediculous, which is fine while we are working on it but I might have a look what I can do with it at some point

----
The Jslider and the forward/rewind buttons seem to be working pretty well with the videos that I tested. Took a bit of time to work out that pressing the button again made the speed go back to normal. I also like how you can drag the Jslider back and forth, would it be possible to get it to jump to a certain time if the user clicks on the Jslider bar?
I've roughly implemented the strip, replace, and overlay features. The overlay feature takes an insanely long amount of time, so I moved everything to a separate swingworker with a hacky progress bar.
Yeah, I've ignored basically all usability issues at the moment, so yeah, any incorrect user input or cancellation will probably crash the whole program. I'll work on that in the next few days.
I agree that the gui is looking a bit messy, I'm not even sure if the audio buttons and progressbars will show up if the screen is too small. I'm not sure what the final layout should be, but something similar to your original sketch would probably be good. We may have to expand the size of the frame though.
Looks like we've done quite a lot in the last few days though! It's looking good :)

----- Minor error fixing. It should no longer require the user to enter a .mp4 extension. Also there should be some checking to ensure that files are of the correct types. Also, cancelling file choosing will no longer throw errors hopefully.

----- Added the option to save either the audio or video when using
the strip button. Some more minor error checking and file type
checking added.

--renamed audio package to editing. renamed OverlayWorker to
AudioWorker. Added TextWorker in same package. There is now a
prototype text editor. It just adds texts with no options at the
moment, using the TextWoker.

prototype text editor.
All the options should now work. Although currently only one font actually works. Also there is very little error checking at the moment.
Text Editor now keeps a record of saved title and credits

**** I have completely changed the gui so that it now looks nice (however there is further work to do)
Basically the main buttons are all in the editor tab and when clicked stuff will popup (such as a progress bar)
Also the source folder of the font was a slightly different name for me so i had to change it to get the text working
*******IMPORTANT************
You need to include some pictures which I have added to make the buttons look nicer. I will send them to you on facebook and they should then be in a folder called assets which should be a source folder in eclipse
Please try it out and make sure i havent broken anything


--- I've merged my changes. Hopefully it still works, although let
me know if I've screwed up. Added a x and y option to the
textsection, along with a preview avplay option.

*** Added load/saving of project but can't work out saving/loading the duration (as it uses that calendar and what not)
(also previously added fullscreen and volume)
apart from that its looking really good :)

-- the duration loading should work now. Also theres a limit to the number of words (currently 20). Also the TextArea is in a scroll pane now.
Now I've added a few more fonts that should work. Fixed the scroll pane a little bit as well.


*** I added some checking to the project load function, it checks its a text file then checks the first line matchs what i put in the first line
Initialised strings so there is no null when loading projects
I added to the ismediafile so it accepts .avi as the bunny video nasser used was an avi.
